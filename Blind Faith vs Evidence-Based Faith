## Blind Faith vs Evidence-Based Faith

God gave you a brain for a reason. It's about time people stop being blinded by their own dogma.

The more I delve into this topic, the more I realize the importance of blind faith. It provides comfort, allowing people to live a life sane enough to get by day by day. However, I believe evidence-based faith is even more crucial. Blind faith can be dangerous, and anyone who disagrees might not have faced its harsh consequences yet.

I'm not just talking about believing in a god; this applies to believing in anything. If you don't know something, you remain ignorant of it. Understanding the bigger picture equips you to build a better foundation and improve yourself.

But could knowing too much be a problem? I'm debating this with myself. On one hand, it could be; on the other, it might not be. Maybe it's not even the right question to ask.

Returning to the idea of **blind faith vs. evidence-based faith**, perhaps this too is the wrong approach. Blind faith can keep a person sane and worry-free. Balancing both is important, but perhaps more crucial is having "**evidence-based blind faith**." When you know something for sure, you can follow it blindly, knowing that everything will work out in the end.

Therefore, when it comes to blind faith, we should consider two types of blind-faith followers:

1.  **Pure Blind Followers**: These individuals follow so blindly that they are doomed by their own dogma, trapped in their beliefs.
2.  **Evidence-Informed Blind Followers**: These individuals base their blind faith on enough evidence to secure their position.

Logically, we know that nobody would willingly trust a killer or an abuser without evidence. Therefore, it makes sense to base our beliefs on evidence, enough to keep us sane.

It's better to approach faith in anything with a hybrid approach.
